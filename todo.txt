stuff that I need to do:

-set base address of kernel to be 0xc0100000			    #done
-change kernel physical address to 0x100000			    #done
-figure out how to switch from protected mode to real mode #done
-store paging stuff starting at address 0x9000			    #done
-enable A20 mode  #done


-need to load second stage bootloader
-need to setup recursive paging
-need to figure out how to implement keyboard driver, screen driver and file systems.
-read up on linker scripts to understand how each segment is being mapped.
